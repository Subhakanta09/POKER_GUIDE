    <h1>How to Create a Poker playing Bot</h1>
    <p>We will be using <b>Python</b> and use its library called <code>PyPokerEngine</code></p>
    <h2>Steps to Create a Poker AI Bot</h2>  
    <ol>  
        <li>  
            Create a <code>PokerBot</code> class that is a subclass of   
            <code>PypokerEngine.players.BasePokerPlayer</code>. We will make several bots   
            starting from basic actions to slightly advanced versions.  
        </li>  
        <li>  
            Implement the abstract methods that inherit from the   
            <code>BasePokerPlayer</code> class.  
        </li>  
    </ol>  
    
    <h2>Methods to Implement</h2>  
    <p>The <code>BasePokerPlayer</code> class requires you to implement 6 methods.However, we have made the task easier for you. We have created a class <code> CountingBot</code> which inherits all required methods from <code>BasePokerPlayer</code> This serves as a parent bot.
        You only need to tinker with the <code>declare_action(...)</code> portion.  All you need to do is create a class whose superclass will be this <code>CountingBot</code> and then put in your code in the <code>declare_action</code> method.</p>  
    <br>First of all, let us go through the code of <code>CountingBot</code>.</p>

        This provides a framework for a poker playing bot that tracks its actions and outcomes. The partcipants have to code only for the <code>declare_action</code>function. All you need to do is only copy-paste this code in your python notebook. Then , as per instructions given later, code for the <code>declare_action</code> function. You can try simulating gameplays on your own.

<p> A few things to note from the output:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cards are written in the string format. For example <b>HA</b> means <b>Ace of Hearts</b>, <b>CT</b> means <b>Ten of Clubs</b></li>
    <li>Hole cards, community cards are stored as strings in list format. Stack is being stored as dictionary with key-value pairs as 'Bot Name' : Amount.</li>
    <li>Sometimes you might see that the output returns <code>"YourBot" declared "raise:-1"</code>. This indicates that either your bot is going all-in. 
        This usually occurs when a player's remaining stack (chips) is not enough to cover the minimum raise amount required for the current round. When you encounter min_raise or max_raise as -1 in your code, it's important to interpret it as an all-in situation and handle it differently.
        In all our samples we have written the code so as to handle this by setting <code>action,amount </code> to <code> fold, 0</code> respectively.
        However the ideal way to handle this is : </ul>
        <div class="code-section">
        <pre><code class="language-python">
    if raise_action:
        min_raise = raise_action["amount"]["min"]
        max_raise = raise_action["amount"]["max"]
    if min_raise == -1 and max_raise == -1:  # All-in case
        raise_amount = round_state['seats'][round_state['next_player']]['stack'] # Get remaining stack
    else:
        raise_amount = (min_raise + max_raise) / 2
    action = {"action": "raise", "amount": raise_amount}
        </code></pre>
    </div>   
            
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>You must insert the following code snippet in the declare action portion of your code. This is necessary for tracking the moves played by your bot, which in turn is necessary for generating game replays.</p>
<div class="code-section">
        <pre><code class="language-python">
            self.game_history.append({
                "round_state": round_state,
                "valid_actions": valid_actions,
                "action_taken": (action, amount)
            })                
        </code></pre>
    </div>
<p>You can also use this data to make a bot which can track opponent's moves and act accordingly . But you must remember that live tracking of moves is not possible, it can only generate the data of rounds played earlier.</p>

<p>In this code we have used <code>nb_simulation</code> to estimate win rate. The nb_simulations parameter in PyPokerEngine 
typically controls how many Monte Carlo simulations are run for evaluating different actions during decision-making in the poker 
environment. This can help in assessing the best possible move by simulating various scenarios and outcomes based on the current 
game state. A higher number of simulations typically leads to more accurate decision-making. </p>

<h2>Common Pitfall!</h2>
<p>Seeing this some people might feel that an aggresive bot which always raises money or goes all-in might be a good option to win as any bot will tend to play cautiously and will end up folding to high bet-amount.
    However it can easily be tackled as we will show you now.</p>

<p>
The primary goal of the check_bluffing function is to analyze the recent behavior of a specific opponent (in this case, ABot) to determine if they might be bluffing frequently.
<br>
<b>Logic</b>
<ol>
<li>Gather Opponent's History: It attempts to access the opponent's game history, stored in opponent_name.game_history_df. This DataFrame presumably contains records of the opponent's actions in previous rounds.</li>

<li>Focus on Recent Rounds: It isolates the opponent's actions from the last two rounds to focus on their recent behavior. If fewer than two rounds have been played, it uses all available rounds.</li>

<li>Calculate Raise Frequency:<br>
It iterates through the opponent's actions within the selected rounds.It keeps track of the total number of actions (s) and the number of raise actions (c).
It calculates the ratio c/s, representing the opponent's raise frequency.
<li>Return Results: The function returns the values of c and s. These values will be used by the AggressivePlayer to decide whether to play more aggressively against a potentially bluffing opponent.</li>
</ol>

    Whenever it prints PLAYING AGGRESSIVELY , it means <code>AggressivePlayer</code> has detected bluffing.Then it acts accordingly. You can see our <code>AggressivePlayer</code> wins easily.
<br>
 So instead of going all-in and playing aggressively, we encourage you to find/design algorithms to play Poker in an optimal manner.

 <p>The main part of this bot is the fucntion <code>evaluate_hand_strength</code>. This function aims to provide a basic estimate of the strength of a player's hand, given their hole cards and the community cards on the table. It's a simplified evaluation, primarily used to guide the bot's decision-making process.
    <br>How it Works:<br>
    <ul>   
    <li>Card Ranks: The function first extracts the ranks of all cards in the hand (hole cards + community cards). PyPokerEngine's Card.from_str(card).rank is used to convert card strings into numerical rank values (e.g., Ace = 14, King = 13, etc.).</li>
    <li> Summing Ranks: The ranks of all cards in the hand are added together.</li>
    <li>Average Rank: The total sum of ranks is divided by the total number of cards to calculate an average rank for the hand.</li>
    <li>Hand Strength: This average rank is then used as a proxy for hand strength. A higher average rank suggests a stronger hand.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    It's important to note that this evaluation method is a simplification. It doesn't consider the suits of the cards or potential hand combinations (like flushes or straights). It purely focuses on the raw rank values of the cards.

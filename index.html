    <h1>How to Create a Poker playing Bot</h1>
    <p>We will be using <b>Python</b> and use its library called <code>PyPokerEngine</code></p>
    <h2>Steps to Create a Poker AI Bot</h2>  
    <ol>  
        <li>  
            Create a <code>PokerBot</code> class that is a subclass of   
            <code>PypokerEngine.players.BasePokerPlayer</code>. We will make several bots   
            starting from basic actions to slightly advanced versions.  
        </li>  
        <li>  
            Implement the abstract methods that inherit from the   
            <code>BasePokerPlayer</code> class.  
        </li>  
    </ol>  
    
    <h2>Methods to Implement</h2>  
    <p>The <code>BasePokerPlayer</code> class requires you to implement 6 methods.However, we have made the task easier for you. We have created a class <code> CountingBot</code> which inherits all required methods from <code>BasePokerPlayer</code> This serves as a parent bot.
        You only need to tinker with the <code>declare_action(...)</code> portion.  All you need to do is create a class whose superclass will be this <code>CountingBot</code> and then put in your code in the <code>declare_action</code> method.</p>

<p> A few things to note from the output:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cards are written in the string format. For example <b>HA</b> means <b>Ace of Hearts</b>, <b>CT</b> means <b>Ten of Clubs</b></li>
    <li>Sometimes you might see that the output returns <code>"YourBot" declared "raise:-1"</code>.This error occurs whenever the action is not defined or amount is not defined (remains None). We have fixed this error in our bots. However, when you prepare your own bots you must take extra care of it</li>
    <li>Hole cards, community cards are stored as strings in list format. Stack     is being stored as dictionary with key-value pairs as 'Bot Name' : Amount.</li>
</ul>
<h3>You can also play with multiple bots. You just need to register them using <code>config.register_player(name="BotName", algorithm=algo)</code>.</h3>
    
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>You must insert the following code snippet in the declare action portion of your code. This is necessary for tracking the moves played by your bot, which in turn is necessary for generating game replays.</p>
<div class="code-section">
        <pre><code class="language-python">
            self.game_history.append({

            })                
        </code></pre>
    </div>
<p>You can also use this data to make a bot which can track opponent's moves and act accordingly . But you must remember that live tracking of moves is not possible, it can only generate the data of rounds played earlier.</p>

<p>In this code we have used <code>nb_simulation</code> to estimate win rate. The nb_simulations parameter in PyPokerEngine 
typically controls how many Monte Carlo simulations are run for evaluating different actions during decision-making in the poker 
environment. This can help in assessing the best possible move by simulating various scenarios and outcomes based on the current 
game state. A higher number of simulations typically leads to more accurate decision-making. </p>

<h2>Common Pitfall!</h2>
<p>Seeing this some people might feel that an aggresive bot which always raises money or goes all-in might be a good option to win as any bot will tend to play cautiously and will end up folding to high bet-amount.
    However it can easily be tackled as we will show you now.</p>

<p>
The primary goal of the check_bluffing function is to analyze the recent behavior of a specific opponent (in this case, ABot) to determine if they might be bluffing frequently.
<br>
<b>Logic</b>
<ol>
<li>Gather Opponent's History: It attempts to access the opponent's game history, stored in opponent_name.game_history_df. This DataFrame presumably contains records of the opponent's actions in previous rounds.</li>

<li>Focus on Recent Rounds: It isolates the opponent's actions from the last two rounds to focus on their recent behavior. If fewer than two rounds have been played, it uses all available rounds.</li>

<li>Calculate Raise Frequency:<br>
It iterates through the opponent's actions within the selected rounds.It keeps track of the total number of actions (s) and the number of raise actions (c).
It calculates the ratio c/s, representing the opponent's raise frequency.
<li>Return Results: The function returns the values of c and s. These values will be used by the AggressivePlayer to decide whether to play more aggressively against a potentially bluffing opponent.</li>
</ol>

    Whenever it prints PLAYING AGGRESSIVELY , it means <code>ap</code> has detected bluffing.Then it acts accordingly. You can clearly see our <code>AggressivePlayer</code> wins easily.

<h3>
 So instead of going all-in and playing aggressively, we encourage you to find/design algorithms to play Poker. The best bot can be created only by a combination of game theory, statistics and machine learning !!!
